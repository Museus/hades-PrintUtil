    Dependencies: ModUtil

    Contains functions to print to the screen in an efficient and customizable
    manner, and to get the current stack trace, to determine who is calling a
    function and from where.

    Should be the very first mod loaded after ModUtil, as any mods relying on
    it need it to be loaded.
